<h1>Who do you think deserves your seat and why? (as per below pic)</h1><p>Since this is a hypothetical question ( and the graphical image too), so it needs hypothetical answers too. Moreover no need to lodge your hearts into a trauma and feel free to answer as we all can guess if all A B C D are that much needy, why will they travel in a crowded Public vehicle. So lets be polite and frank to consider some points -</p><p>Either this is a local metro or a city bus, none of the four are supposed to use this vehicle in such conditions.</p><p>Read in some answers that the D guy is drug addict and is prone to death in near future. I guess he is a beggar and also suffering from a skin disease. So either you get a seat or not that is not worth discussing ahead of the other three.</p><p>The guy C seems to be a lame with a support stick. So you can also lean by a bus/ metro wallside and grab a support belt provided over your head. Since you decided to travel in a crowded bus in such a case, it means your legs are not that much affected ( not judging ) and you can rest your ass anywhere in the bus.</p><p>The lady B seems an old woman. I have soft corners for you Granny. I know its very hard to stand for so long and that too in a moving Vehicle. So if you have decided to go in this train/ bus that too Alone means you are not very old to get a special treatment. But considering the others you can be offered a seat if others allow so.</p><p>The lady A has every hands raised for her. And yes she deserves it too. Neglecting the fact that she is travelling by a Public bus in such a condition, she well deserves a seat. Not sure but I can see a pregnancy bulge on her. So another fact of negligience. It would be very harsh on her to say that either you stand or get a seat, both cases are dangerous for both of your babies. Im not a doctor but I think it is more good if you travel standing in the bus (grabbing the support belts strongly and getting a support from Bus walls) and give your other child to any lady who is on a seat. If somebody offers you a seat, thats really praising.</p><p></p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e61bddc0e68f01f8255d60faa5589bca-c" ><p>Now here comes my guy. So why should he offer his seat to any of the late commers ?? He is a man who works in a company for 16hours on a low wage. He travels 50kilometers daily up and down for the job and is tired as hell. He is a doctor going to his hospital very distant. He is a common man who is suffering from high fever and any other disease. He is going to visit a funeral of his relative/ dear ones. He grabbed the bus from the second stoppage and was standing for next 30stoppages and got the seat few minutes ago. He has Gastroentritis in his stomach or urgency to use a Commode and can’t stand. He has his trousers torn from Buttocks. He is sitting with his GF for the first time or his wife. He is an elite buisnessman and standind in a bus is against his ego. He feels to vomit so he is sitting near to a window. The seat has some springs and nails popping out, nobody sat on it so he decided to sit on it with his ass forbidden. He is sitting near window to see where his client is standing on the road and if he stands in the bus he nomore gets a visual of outside.</p><p></p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6daf6c982114641af51926dec418612c-c" ><p>If you ask for my opinion acc. to this image I would say - </p><h1>Is your profile photo an actual photo of you?</h1><p>Is your profile photo an actual photo of you?</p><p>Why yes, yes it is.</p><p>Well, it is and it isn’t…</p><p>Below is the actual version I currently use (10/2018) on more than one site:</p><p></p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4e260f6c94cb5512fb3ee44c394353b7" ><p>Being a retired professional photographer I occasionally do the narcissistic thing, and I usually do it in a mirror, </p><p>There's a progression to this but it's boring so read no further if’n ya don't wanna.</p><p></p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f6e81667fe84188296ec68e2823d92f0" ><p>Above is the original, of course mirror-imaged. Main light is a 100W (equivalent) daylight LED in an $8 clamp-lamp bounced into a corner of wall and ceiling to camera right. A ceiling fixture above and behind to camera left provides the kicker, warm because the lamps are warm-white. I like it because I think it looks like a little golden-hour sun getting in.</p><p>The red backdrop makes it easier to cut away the background to substitute something else, such as the woodsy stock shot from Pexels I used.</p><p>A tip for mirror selfies: Always remember to clean the mirror if you don't want to spend 20 minutes spotting out dust. ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ</p><p>The original file gets flipped horizontally to be right way around, processed first in Lightroom, some retouching done in PortraitPro17 (I am that vain, yes), then taken into Photoshop for precise elimination of the background…</p><p></p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3834555c4058eb91482890e32259c72d" ><p></p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8f45ad9eafaf7bab233618811812a74b" ><p>Finally the replacement background is prepared, in this case by cropping a vertical section out of a horizontal plus blurring the sharpness with some Gaussian blur to hopefully add fool-the-eye realism. The two are combined and output as a JPEG which can be cropped any way I wish, including as a tight head shot suitable for avatars.</p><h1>What are some well-timed photos?</h1><p>25 Perfect Photos Taken Right Before a Disaster:</p><p>Ouch!</p><p></p><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1778f5dd2b6ed1e936f5331334992ca0" ><p>Image Source: </p><p>2.
