Wednesday evening, with showers moving in during the overnight hours. Rain, heavy at times, will arrive by Thursday afternoon. Paul Heggen has the forecast. (3/17/21)</p><h3>Video Transcript</h3><p><span class="speaker">PAUL HEGGEN:</span> Things are still dry right now. We're just seeing more clouds overhead. Later on tonight, we're going to see the first of the showers beginning to move in. That's going to be light activity, but the rain is going to pick up in intensity and become more widespread, just a generally wet Thursday. Be very flexible. In fact, rearrange any outdoor plans. Even though there are going to be some breaks in between those waves of rain, it's just going to be wet.</p><p>And then we dry out beginning Friday, but the weekend is looking pretty good. Temperatures are going to start warming up, and there's an actual warm spell in the forecast down the line, days six and seven of that seven day outlook. Let's talk about tonight's rain and tomorrow's rain as well. It's still well off the coast, but it's going to be approaching once we get past midnight.</p><p>So dry weather this evening, and then those shower chances increase by early tomorrow morning. This is going to be light activity, but enough for wet roads for the morning commute. The heaviest rain is still going to be hanging out off the coast, by late morning starting to move into the North Bay, maybe even moving through the Golden Gate.</p><p>But a couple of different ways of heavier rain during the afternoon continuing into the evening. So I think the evening commute is going to be the more complicated half of things by Thursday late in the day. But that heaviest rain then moving off to the east pretty quickly, already clearing out a couple of hours after the sun goes down.</p><p>The clouds will linger the rest of the night, and we could see a few lingering showers on Friday. Those look like they're going to be pretty few and far between. If you're somebody who works outside or you just want to get something done outside on Friday, you should be OK. But there is the outside chance of a couple of showers still lingering for inland parts of the Bay Area.</p><div class="caas-readmore caas-readmore-collapse"><button aria-label="" class="link rapid-noclick-resp caas-button collapse-button" data-ylk="elm:readmore;slk:Story continues" title="">Story continues</button></div><p>And then in the high terrain, it's going to be snow. There's a winter weather advisory that goes into effect at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning, continues until midnight Friday night. Above 5,500 feet, they're talking about six to 12 inches of snow, which isn't that much for the high Sierra. The highest peaks picking up about a foot and a half of snow so travel is likely to be challenging.</p><p>If you're going to be heading up that way, you might wait until Saturday morning when the road crews have had a chance to work on things. But at least it's going to help out the snow pack situation, which is running a little bit better than the Bay Area's rain situation. We're only around 40% of the rain we should have had at this point in the season, the high Sierra picking up about 60% of the snowpack that they should have at this point in the season.</p><p>We don't get any rain out of this one-- which, we're going to, don't worry about that. But the next chance of rain is going to be a long way off. The rest of the seven day forecast looks dry. And beyond that, the rest of March is looking dry. The outlook from the Climate Prediction Center, eight to 14 days, which neatly takes us right through the last day of March, shows a significant chance of below average precipitation not just for the Bay Area, but for most of the West Coast.</p><p>And to go along with that, a significant chance of above average temperatures. Once that warm spell settles in Tuesday and Wednesday, it's likely to be here for about eight or nine days once we look at the really long range data. Today, though, was not warm because of the clouds overhead. Temperatures have struggled up to around 60 degrees inland with mostly low to mid 50s around the Bay and along the coast.</p><p>Temperatures right now aren't a whole lot different though, because that cloud cover is keeping what little warmth we had near ground level. Temperatures in the 50s across the board, anywhere from 50 at Half Moon Bay, to 59 degrees in Fairfield. Those temperatures will only drop back down into the 40s by early tomorrow morning-- again, because of that insulating effect of the clouds overhead.</p><p>And then, high temperatures tomorrow. Well, they're not going to warm up a lot because of the clouds, because of the rain. But at least we're going to manage to get up within shouting distance of 60 degrees, as some of the warm air associated with this storm system is going to try to creep in along with those heavier downpours during the afternoon.</p><p>Along the coast, only mid 50s. Upper 50s to around 60 for the South Bay. Santa Clara Valley, you've got one of the best chances of reaching up into the low 60s. With highs generally around 60 degrees inland in the East Bay, you'll wait a little bit longer for that heavier rain to arrive, but it'll get to you. Temperatures only in the mid 50s for San Francisco, upper 50s on the east side of the Bay, and then mid 50s for the North Bay.</p><p>Even cooler to the north for Mendocino and lake counties, temperatures struggling up to around 50 degrees. As skies start to clear out, we warm up a little bit on Friday, a little bit more on Saturday, more than that on Sunday, maybe a minor step back on Monday. But then, the warm spell settles in Tuesday and Wednesday, and once we get past those lingering showers Friday, no rain through the rest of the seven-day forecast.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article>
