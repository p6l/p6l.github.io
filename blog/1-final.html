<section class="article-content blueprint">
<p><em>Leprechaun </em>is a terrible franchise, but there's never been a better St. Patrick's Day to binge it!</p>
<p>See, in non-pandemic times, I wouldn't recommend watching one of horror's schlockiest offerings — let alone all eight of its installments — when you could be out with friends. Who am I to stand between you and the promise of a well-deserved Guinness, whiskey shot, and/or a green outfit you definitely thought was cuter when you left the house? But these are dire times, at least for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/health/coronavirus-united-states.html" target="_blank">a little while longer</a>. And for that, <em>Leprechaun </em>is absolutely perfect. </p>
<p>Created by writer-director Mark Jones in the early '90s, <em>Leprechaun </em>and its titular villain, named "Lubdan" and played by actor Warwick Davis for all but the last two films, is spectacularly messy.  It's had half a dozen different directors, many more cast members, and a history that began even before the <em>Scream </em>franchise. The result, a wildly uneven blend of comedy and kills, has become an icon of B-level horror, 420-friendly cinema, and, of course, St. Patrick's Day. It's messy, it's stupid, and it's absolutely worth watching at least once.</p>
<p>So, to help you have a truly memorable holiday while still at home, here are all eight of the <em>Leprechaun </em>films, ranked from genuinely bad to "so bad, it's great." (If you're of age, don't forget to google the associated drinking games. There's <a href="https://www.drunkencinema.com/blog/leprechaun-drinking-game" target="_blank">plenty</a> <a href="https://humanechoes.com/st-patties-day-drinking-game-leprechaun-movie-drinking-game/" target="_blank">to</a> <a href="https://macabrebros.wordpress.com/2020/03/17/the-drinking-games-leprechaun-2-1994-quotes/" target="_blank">choose</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/FANGORIA/status/1107325998276796417?s=20" target="_blank">from</a>!) Happy St. Patrick's Day! </p>
<h2>
<strong>8. </strong><em><strong>Leprechaun: Origins </strong></em><strong>(2014)</strong>
</h2>
<div class="youtube-wrapper"><p><iframe data-channel="WWE" data-template="embedded" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zYg51_PFeHA?enablejsapi=1&amp;"></iframe></p></div>
<p>One thing the <em>Leprechaun </em>franchise definitely did <em>not</em> need was a gritty reboot from the WWE. Alas, in 2014, that's what director Zach Lipovsky unleashed onto the world and so, I must rank it.</p>
<p>In this almost unwatchable franchise reboot, professional wrestler Dylan Mark Postle — better known as "Hornswoggle" — plays a far less interesting version of the titular trickster, as encountered by a group of young tourists visiting Ireland. The attacks are more brutal, but the fun is sucked out by an animalistic leprechaun that looks more like an overcooked wonton than a monster. </p>
<p>You could theoretically watch this movie. That is your right.</p>

<strong>7. </strong><em><strong>Leprechaun in the Hood </strong></em><strong>(2000)</strong>
</h2>

<p>As far as dumb ideas go, <em>Leprechaun in the Hood </em>is a great one. The fifth title in the <em>Leprechaun </em>franchise, this 2000 straight-to-home video release (to be clear, nothing after <em>Leprechaun 2</em> saw theaters) follows Lubdan through the Los Angeles rap scene for a lot of campy fun.</p>
<p>From scantily clad "Zombie Fly Girls" to four-leaf clover-laced joints, <em>Leprechaun in the Hood </em>parodies aughts-era hip hop culture by blending Blaxploitation tropes with the ridiculousness one should expect of a <em>Leprechaun </em>sequel. It's a surprisingly winning combination that has earned the film a sizable, and decidedly 420-friendly, following. </p>
<p>However, it should be noted that this title contains some overtly transphobic jokes that are not worth watching. On those grounds, absolutely feel free to skip this one. I always do.</p>

<strong>6. </strong><em><strong>Leprechaun 2 </strong></em><strong>(1994)</strong>
</h2>
<div class="youtube-wrapper"><p><iframe data-channel="Movieclips" data-template="embedded" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AgZGoFX8xWY?enablejsapi=1&amp;"></iframe></p></div>
<p><em>Leprechaun 2 </em>— hilariously, also marketed as <em>One Wedding and Lots of Funerals </em>at the time of its release —<em> </em>sees the franchise just begin to grasp its comedic potential. </p>
<p>Set in 1994 Los Angeles, <em>Leprechaun</em>'s first sequel follows Lubdan as he tries to kidnap and wed some poor guy's girlfriend thanks to a thousand-year-old curse. It's a relatively lame outing compared to where the fiendish villain would eventually go, but does see Lubdan come into his own as a walking one-liner with a shitty attitude. It's good enough, but by no means mandatory viewing.</p>

<strong>5. </strong><em><strong>Leprechaun 4: In Space </strong></em><strong>(1997)</strong>
</h2>

<p>OK, "<em>Leprechaun </em>but put it in space" is exactly the low-hanging fruit you think it is. That said, this sci-fi romp (with a truly surprising amount of nudity) will always hold a special place in my heart. </p>
<p>In it, director Brian Trenchard-Smith, also responsible for the excellent <em>Leprechaun 3, </em>sends Lubdan to the year 2096 for a completely inexplicable outing with an intergalactic princess and a slew of space marines. It's one of those campy movies that never seems to take itself seriously enough to land, and there's a lot about it that's just kind of gross and stupid. But the schlocky script and over-the-top visuals make for an adequately bonkers watch. It's worth seeing once, but only once.</p>

<strong>4. </strong><em><strong>Leprechaun </strong></em><strong>(1993)</strong>
</h2>

<p>Ah, it's the misguided idea that started it all. I just might shed a tear! </p>
<p>Undeniably, the best argument for watching the first <em>Leprechaun </em>is Jennifer Aniston. Yep, <em>that </em><a href="https://mashable.com/article/were-the-millers-jennifer-aniston/">Jennifer Aniston</a>. Get in on the ground floor with this ridiculous saga by watching Aniston's feature-length debut as Tory Reding, a not terribly well-written scream queen the actor has made it clear <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3588268/jennifer-aniston-reflects-movie-introduced-jennifer-aniston-world-leprechaun/" target="_blank">she'd rather forget</a>. Set in North Dakota at the infamous O'Grady farmhouse, <em>Leprechaun </em>follows Tory as she acclimates to life outside the big city, which coincidentally involves fighting an evil leprechaun who tells really mean rhymes. "<em>This old Lep, he played one, he played pogo </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9L9S7jEv_M" target="_blank"><em>on his lung</em></a><em>!" </em></p>

<strong>3. </strong><em><strong>Leprechaun 3 </strong></em><strong>(1995)</strong>
</h2>

<p>Lubdan's 1995 trip to Las Vegas is really where this franchise started to pick up steam. In <em>Leprechaun 3, </em>director Brian Trenchard-Smith crafts a poorly paced but remarkably extravagant adventure that lets everyone's favorite green-wearing asshole be the showboat he is. You've got some really fun kills, for sure, but the real delight in this project comes in the less aggressive moments. I mean, Lubdan just absolutely gorging himself on casino potatoes? Because he's a leprechaun? Brilliant! Incredible! Amazing! Again! </p>

<strong>2. </strong><em><strong>Leprechaun: Back 2 tha Hood</strong></em><strong> (2003)</strong>
</h2>
<div class="youtube-wrapper"><p><iframe data-channel="Movieclips" data-template="embedded" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j67MZXY33c0?enablejsapi=1&amp;"></iframe></p></div>
<p>If any part of you is a fan of the <em>Scary Movie </em>franchise, <em>Leprechaun</em>'s sixth outing was made for you. </p>
<p>Writer-director Steven Ayromlooi's truly hysterical follow-up to <em>Leprechaun in the Hood </em>(which doesn't actually continue that story at all) takes us back to Los Angeles for a far stronger take on Lubdan in the big city. With a tremendously capable ensemble cast and Davis performing at the absolute top of his game — <em>Back 2 tha Hood </em>was his final film before leaving the franchise — this sequel really crystallizes all that the other heavily comedic <em>Leprechaun </em>movies could have been.</p>
<p>Highlights to look forward to include: an LAPD officer pulling a Black Knight from <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail, </em>Lubdan facing <em>his </em>worst death yet, and a whole lot of weed humor. You'll love it.</p>

<strong>1. </strong><em><strong>Leprechaun Returns </strong></em><strong>(2018) </strong>
</h2>
<div class="youtube-wrapper"><p><iframe data-channel="IGN" data-template="embedded" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q8xnd3qSg5I?enablejsapi=1&amp;"></iframe></p></div>
<p>Known in 2021 for his cult hit <a href="https://mashable.com/article/pg-psycho-goreman/"><em>PG: Psycho Goreman</em></a><em>,</em> director Steven Kostanski resurrected the<em> Leprechaun </em>franchise after its lackluster reboot — and thank Saint Patrick he did. Instead of continuing the gritty tenor established in <em>Leprechaun: Origins, </em>Kostanski<em> </em>takes fans back to the camp of the original, setting his film 25 years after the events of <em>Leprechaun </em>(1993) and reestablishing the series as a source of gorey, goofy spectacle<em>.</em></p>
<p>Taylor Spreitler stars as Lila, the daughter of Aniston's character from the first film, who returns to the O'Grady farmhouse for a philanthropy project. But little does Lila know, Luban, played by actor Linden Porco for the first time, is still there seeking his gold. </p>
<p>The most polished <em>Leprechaun </em>title to date, <em>Leprechaun Returns </em>has solid acting, a fun script, and truly inventive special effects. It's a top-to-bottom blast, worth watching twice.</p>
